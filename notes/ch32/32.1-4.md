## The Question

Suppose we allow the pattern P to contain occurrences of a **gap character** \* 
that can match an arbitrary string of characters (even one of zero length). 
For example, the pattern *ab\*ba\*c* occurs in the text *cabccbacbacab* as

’ ’ ’ “ ’ c ab c ’ — ’ ’ ’ c ab :

c ab cc ba cba ab } ba } and as c ab ccbac ba

ab } ba

}

c 990

Note that the gap character may occur an arbitrary number of times in the pattern but not at all in the text. Give a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether such a pattern P occurs in a given text T , and analyze the running time of your algorithm.
