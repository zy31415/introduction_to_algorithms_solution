## The Question

Suppose we allow the pattern P to contain occurrences of a **gap character** \* 
that can match an arbitrary string of characters (even one of zero length). 
For example, the pattern *ab\*ba\*c* occurs in the text *cabccbacbacab* as

’ ’ ’ “ ’ c ab c ’ — ’ ’ ’ c ab :

c ab cc ba cba ab } ba } and as c ab ccbac ba

ab } ba

}

c 990

Note that the gap character may occur an arbitrary number of times in the pattern but not at all in the text. 
Give a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether such a pattern P occurs in a given text T , 
and analyze the running time of your algorithm.


## Solution

### Solution One

We can decompose the pattern P with g-1 gap characters into the form a<sub>1</sub> \* a<sub>2</sub> \* ... \* a<sub>g</sub>.
Then once we find the first occurrence of a<sub>1</sub> in the string T, 
we can proceed to match a<sub>2</sub> with the rest of the string.
Once we find the first occurrence of a<sub>2</sub> after a<sub>1</sub>, we can proceed to find a<sub>3</sub>, 
and so on until we could verify all occurrences of components of P one after the other 
to show that T contains P. 
Evidently, the algorithm can be implemented recursively.
Note that the question asks to just verify whether the string contains the pattern, not to find all occurrence.
This simplifies the problem.

### Solution Two

Convert this problem into a Wildcard Matching problem, which can be solved through dynamic programming.
